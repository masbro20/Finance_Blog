                <div class="row gx-4 gx-lg-5 justify-content-center">
                    <div class="col-md-10 col-lg-8 col-xl-7">
                        <h2 class="section-heading">Balance Sheet</h2>
                        <p>This is probably the easiest one. Here are the basics: assets are stuff with value. Liabilities are like loans and IOUs you use to get cash to buy the assets. You just tally up how much of each asset and liability you have, then the difference is your equity—kinda like a house. If it’s worth $600,000, and you have a loan for $400,000, your equity is worth $200,000. Similarly if you own an ice cream company, and it’s worth $2 M but you pulled out a loan to start it for $1.5 M, your equity would only be $500,000.</p>
                        <p>What if you worked your tail off over the summer running an ice cream stand at a nearby lake to increase sales, and your company becomes popular to the thousands of vacationers at the lake? Then maybe the value of your company to buyers would increase to $3M, and your equity would be worth $1.5M! That’s essentially what makes finance exciting.</p>
                        <h2 class="section-heading">Income Statement</h2>
                        <p>The income statement is simple: revenue (sales) minus expenses (costs) gives us income. People like to separate different costs, like cost of goods sold, facilities rent, and interest on loans.</p>
                        <p>Just brings up the subject of accruals, which are basically build-ups of something that needs to be paid in cash later.</p>
                        <blockquote class="blockquote">The dreams of yesterday are the hopes of today and the reality of tomorrow. Science has not yet mastered prophecy. We predict too much for the next year and yet far too little for the next ten.</blockquote>
                        <h2 class="section-heading">Difference between Finance and Accounting</h2>
                        <p>Accounting looks BACKWARD, Finance looks FORWARD. Both are challenging and monetarily rewarding fields of work. Finance tends to be more strategy-focused and idealistic, while accounting tends toward realism by preparing statements and checking for accuracy-making sure everyone’s following the rules.</p>
                        <p>Finance jobs tend to be more lucrative and prestigious, which is why many accounting professionals plan to pivot anyway. However, accounting is becoming more respected and in high-demand, partly because schooling is more intense and the work is less enjoyable but in some cases more essential, especially for small companies. In addition, accounting is more secure in the traditional Finance route, meaning that occasionally finance professionals find themselves repurposed or without a job during economic recessions and when their company comes on hard times.</p>

                        <p>Space, the final frontier. These are the voyages of the Starship Enterprise. Its five-year mission: to explore strange new worlds, to seek out new life and new civilizations, to boldly go where no man has gone before.</p>
                        <p>As I stand out here in the wonders of the unknown at Hadley, I sort of realize there’s a fundamental truth to our nature, Man must explore, and this is exploration at its greatest.</p>
